This generates a website, where it lists all the albums which it founds from Audirvana application database.

INSTALL
========

- Copy all these files to your server
- Get bootstrap and AngularJS 
- Copy a copy of your Audirvana database on the server 
- Make sure all the permissions are set to your web server (eg. can this script create cover art folder, 
  can it read SQLite database etc.)

NOTE: This is a project which I have done for learning basic bootstrap and AngularJS stuff.
      It is NOT very well made, I just made quickly to test things. Use at own risk if you want to.
